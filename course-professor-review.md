# Course Professor Review

The course professor is an electrical engineer. He was polite with us and
satisfied with the course curriculum.

I don't have any complaints about him. He might just be more serious, maybe.

I have to say, according to the course paradigm, or the way the course was
managed, I really enjoyed it because I was able to create all these great
articles!. I chose to use LaTeX, and publish my own works here. Of course, it
sucks to convert LaTeX to Markdown, from Spanish to English, but it was a great
opportunity to develop my experience in writing these kinds of professional
articles with my own style, and standards. This way, I can pass the course, and
take something useful for me in real life like the articles published on my
website at the same time.

If you speak Spanish, you can go to his YouTube channel to see that he actually
works, unlike most professors I've had who don't work properly, or at all.
