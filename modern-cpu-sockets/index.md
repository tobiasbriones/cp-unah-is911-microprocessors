# Modern CPU Sockets

This research framework provides a summary of existing modern PC sockets in
2022.

## Introduction

Sockets are connectors that allow physical and electrical connectivity from the
microprocessor to the motherboard. They are also known as "slots".

As mentioned above, we can make the following statement about sockets:

> A **CPU socket** or **CPU slot** contains one or more mechanical
> components providing mechanical and electrical connections between a
> microprocessor and a printed circuit board (PCB). This allows for placing and
> replacing the central processing unit (CPU) without soldering.

To list some types of sockets, we have [1]: TR4, AM4, LGA 1151, 2066, sTRX4.
When designing a configuration for a PC, it must be taken into account that the
motherboard is compatible with the rest of the chosen hardware and, in
particular, that the socket is the one that corresponds to the model of the CPU
that must be installed.

### Definition

A simple definition of a socket is:

> The socket refers to a physical connector on a computer motherboard that
> accepts a single physical chip. Many motherboards can have multiple sockets 
> that can in turn accept multi-core chips.
